## Opinions

Overall rating (1-10): 7-8?

Nikolai:
  - favorite chapters were the first 5
  - information hiding and strategic vs tactical use of tools
  - Java first context
    - the author taught Java programming at Stanford
    - a good name in many times relates information better than a comment

Derek:
  - human centric approach: code is written for humans, not for machines
  - this book is very approachable

Justin:
  - The book reminds me of:
    - The Humane Representation of Thought - Bret Victor  
    - "The New Gold Standard" The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company  
  - the author seems to have the "ivory tower" academic perspective  
    - they are not really in the trenches
    - we should take their timelines with a huge grain of salt

Manuel:
  - Can we use the book to inform code reviews?
  - I don't like the way he talks about fixing things tactically, then addressing the debt afterwords

Brian:
  - be careful with our arguments from authority
    - 14.5 talks about go code styling
    - this book has generic recommendations with the lens of java development
  - we should be using the go conventions
    - https://gist.github.com/adamveld12/c0d9f0d5f0e1fba1e551
  - compare spoken languages to programming languages
    - the culture of the people who use the language matter matters a lot to their use
    - the language matters a lot, the compiler and runtimes support the patterns
    - a lot of this book is really meant for OOP with a bend towards java
    - some of the recommendations are an anti-patterns in other languages
  - did not like the idea of writing comments before writing the code
  - package level comments are good, higher level comments are easier to maintain

Hussein:
  - everything that the author described with bad software we have encountered before
  - a good design could have saved us way more than 20% of our time refactoring

Matt:
  - is this basically Clean Code?
    - this is different from clean code, specifically around small functions
    - in short, the author specifically says it isn't in the book
